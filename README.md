# RkBackend

Rk will provide public and private organisations with a service that will register complains or advises. This registration will be analysed and classified by an AI system.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
